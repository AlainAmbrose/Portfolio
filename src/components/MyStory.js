      <p>
        Hey! Im currently a Junior studying Computer Science at the University
        of Central FloridaI started seriously learning and applying computer
        science concepts right before college. Since that point I have worked
        every day to get better with my problem solving, critical thinking,
        communication skills, and teamwork. I'm committed to putting in effort
        to learn through internship experience and am looking forward to growing
        as I move forward.
